			As the popular saying goes, “it costs money to make money.”Common expenses include payments to suppliers, employee wages,
			factory leases, and equipment depreciation. Businesses are allowed to write off tax-deductible expenses on their income
			tax returns to lower their taxable income and thus their tax liability. However, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has
			strict rules on which expenses business are allowed to claim as a deduction.</td>
